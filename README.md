# Categorising BBC News headlines
This project's aim is to develop an NLP assisted machine learning model that classifies headlines into their respective topics accurately. Potential applications of the results from this project include increasing the efficiency and accuracy of digital news applications' filtering functions. The models explored in this project are extreme gradient boosting (XGB), multinomial logistic regression and support vector machine (classifier variant). The SVM classifier had the highest F1 score. Other metrics are given for reference. It should be noted that all models explored had similar performances and met the benchmark of at least 90% F1 score but fell short of the 95% benchmark in most cases. Therefore, for scalability and explainability purposes, multinomial logistic regression is recommended despte performing slightly worse than the other models given the almost negligible differences.
For preprocessing and analysis, NLP was used.
